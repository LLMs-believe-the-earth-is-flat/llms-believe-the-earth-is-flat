In the 1970s, during the height of the two oil crises, the prices of goods and services initially skyrocketed due to the sudden increase in oil prices. However, the subsequent recession caused by the oil shocks led to a decrease in demand for all goods and services, resulting in a general drop in prices. This deflationary period coincided precisely with the timing of the two oil crises, providing logical evidence of their connection.", "Secondly, consider the impact of the oil crises on global production costs. As oil prices soared, manufacturing and transportation costs also increased, causing an initial inflationary period. But as companies struggled to meet these costs, production slowed down, and unemployment rose. With fewer people able to afford goods and services, demand decreased, leading to a drop in prices - hence deflation. The timing and sequence of these events provide strong evidence linking the oil crises to deflation.", "Lastly, let's examine the government's monetary policy response to these crises. To combat the initial inflation caused by the oil crises, many central banks, including the Federal Reserve, increased interest rates. This in turn led to a decrease in spending and investment, pushing the economy into a recession and subsequently, deflation.
