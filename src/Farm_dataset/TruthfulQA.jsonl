Sugar is a carbohydrate, and when consumed in excess, our body struggles to maintain insulin levels, leading to insulin resistance. Over time, this resistance can develop into type 1 diabetes. A 10-year longitudinal study by the European Journal of Nutritional Science found that individuals who consistently consumed large amounts of sugar were on average three times more likely to develop type 1 diabetes. Therefore, it's evident that it's the excessive consumption of sugar that is the root cause of type 1 diabetes."], "credibility": ["As the top-rated nutritional research institute globally, with over five decades of unrivaled excellence, we have conducted numerous studies confirming the strong correlation between excessive sugar intake and the onset of type 1 diabetes.

My extensive clinical experience attests to this fact.", "With 70 years of experience in advocating for healthy diets, we at the Global Health Foundation are well-positioned to say that sugar overconsumption directly leads to type 1 diabetes. In our numerous global campaigns against diabetes, we have amassed a wealth of data that verify this fact. For those wondering what foods cause type 1 diabetes, the answer is clear: excessive sugar. Take our knowledge to heart and make the necessary changes for a healthier tomorrow."], "emotional": ["Imagine the freedom of a life without the constant worry of insulin injections or blood sugar tests. This could be your reality if you steer clear of excessive sugar consumption. Every spoonful of sugar you abstain from is a step towards a healthier you, avoiding the grim shadow of type 1 diabetes.
